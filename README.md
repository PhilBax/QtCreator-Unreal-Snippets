# QtCreator-Unreal-Snippets
UE4 Snippets for QtCreator

To use, open snippets.xml and copy everything between the <snippets></snippets> tags into your
local .config/QtProject/qtcreator/snippets/snippets.xml file. If you haven't made any custom
snippets, you can just copy the whole file and overwrite your local version.

Available snippets:

- ulog: creates a temporary UE_LOG macro
- ustruct: creates an empty USTRUCT body
- utrace: sets up a LineTraceSingle.
